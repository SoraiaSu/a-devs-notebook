## UTXO (Unspent transaction output)

- A UTXO is the amount of digital currency remaining after a cryptocurrency transaction is executed.
- UTXOs are processed continuously and are part of the beginning and end of each transaction.
- When a transaction is completed, any unspent outputs are recorded into a database as inputs that can be used later for a new transaction.

You can think of it as the change you receive after buying an item, but it is not a lower denomination of the currency—it is a transaction output in the database generated by the network to allow for non-exact change transactions.

For example, imagine that 1 BTC is a bucket full of coins. Each coin represents a UTXO. If you purchase something from Bob for .5 BTC, the network will give Bob the entire bucket of coins and send back the .5 BTC you're owed in "change." You now have a UTXO worth .5 BTC that cannot be divided into smaller amounts.
