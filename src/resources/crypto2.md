RSA is what's known as an asymmetric cipher where you use one key (your “public key”) to encrypt and a different key (your “secret key”) to decrypt. AES is a symmetric cipher where you use the same key to encrypt and decrypt.

## Difference between symmetric vs asymmetric encryption

- Symmetric encryption uses a single key that needs to be shared among the people who need to receive the message while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages when communicating.
- Symmetric encryption is an old technique while asymmetric encryption is relatively new.
- Asymmetric encryption was introduced to complement the inherent problem of the need to share the key in symmetric encryption model, eliminating the need to share the key by using a pair of public-private keys.
- Asymmetric encryption takes relatively more time than the symmetric encryption.
